# LancerWiki

A wiki for the Mitsubishi Lancer.

This wiki is a collection of information about the Mitsubishi Lancer, including the history, models, and modifications. It is designed to be a comprehensive resource for Lancer enthusiasts and owners.

This was designed because I was sick of there being so many different trims of Lancer and no documentation for any of them. I wanted to create a resource that would help people understand the differences between the various models and trims, as well as provide information on how to modify and maintain their Lancer.
